## 📋 Project Overview

DesktopMemo is a desktop memo application based on .NET 9.0 + WPF + CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, providing rich window management features and memo management capabilities. Whether it's daily notes, work memos, or inspiration records, it provides you with a convenient solution.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📝 Memo Management
- Quickly create and edit Markdown-formatted memos
- Auto-save, never lose your notes
- List view for quick preview

### ✅ Todo List
- Lightweight todo list management
- Quick add, check, and delete todo items
- Completed items shown with strikethrough, can undo or clear
- Click "Memo/Todo List" text in the title bar to switch modes

### 🪟 Window Management
- Three stay-on-top modes (Normal, Desktop, Always on Top)
- Adjustable transparency and click-through mode
- Flexible window position presets

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 version 1903 and above (WPF dependency)
- **Architecture**: x86_64
- **.NET SDK**: 9.0 (for development/debugging)
- **.NET runtime**: Built into the release package, no additional installation required

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: .NET 9.0, WPF
- **Pattern**: MVVM (based on CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Persistence**: Markdown + YAML Front Matter; Window settings use JSON
- **Toolchain**: PowerShell build scripts, GitHub Actions (planned)

## 🚀 Quick Start

If you are a regular user, you can go to [Releases](../../releases) to get the application and run it directly

### Shortcuts

> Global
- `Ctrl+N` - Quickly create new memo
> Only available on edit page
- `Tab` - Insert indentation (4 spaces)
- `Shift + Tab` - Decrease indentation
- `Ctrl + S` - Save current memo (seems unnecessary)
- `Ctrl + Tab` / `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` - Switch memos
- `Ctrl + F` / `Ctrl + H` - Find/Replace
- `F3` / `Shift + F3` - Find next/previous
- `Ctrl + ]` / `Ctrl + [` - Increase/decrease indentation
- `Ctrl + D` - Duplicate current line downward

### Manual Build
If you need to debug the project or participate in development, you can follow the steps below

#### Get Source Code

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/SaltedDoubao/DesktopMemo.git
cd DesktopMemo
```

#### Build and Run

```powershell
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore DesktopMemo.sln

# Debug build
dotnet build DesktopMemo.sln --configuration Debug

# Run application
dotnet run --project src/DesktopMemo.App/DesktopMemo.App.csproj --configuration Debug
```

> To build an executable file, you can use `build_exe.bat` in the repository root. Build artifacts are output to `artifacts/v<version>/bin` by default. You can customize the version number by setting the environment variable `ArtifactsVersion`.

On first run, `/.memodata` will be generated in the executable directory:

```
.memodata/
├── content/
│   ├── index.json           # (before v2.3.0) Memo index
│   └── {memoId}.md          # YAML Front Matter + content
├── .logs/                   # (v2.3.0 and later) Log files directory
├── settings.json            # Window and global settings
├── memos.db                 # (v2.3.0 and later) Local SQLite database for memos and notes data
└── todos.db                 # (v2.3.0 and later) Local SQLite database for todo items data
```

<details>
<summary>Importing Old Data (for users before v2.0.0)</summary>

Data from versions before v2.0.0 is not compatible with the new version and can be imported as follows:

**Automatic Import** (Recommended):
1. Ensure the old application data directory (`Data/content/`) is in the application directory
2. The program will automatically import old data on first run
3. Manually delete the Data directory after import is complete
4. Done!

**Manual Import**
* You can also choose to manually copy the previous text and paste it into the new version memo
